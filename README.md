This project counts for 15% of the total grade.

# The Sudoku Game

This game from Japan is represented in a 9*9 grid, divided into 9 squares of 9 boxes. Some boxes already contain a number from 1 to 9. The goal is to fill the empty boxes so that each square, each row, and each column contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition. In other words, we should not find 2 identical numbers in the same square, the same row, or the same column.


# To Submit:

- [ ] A 2-3 page report containing:
    1. A brief description of what has been accomplished in this project
    2. An explanation of the heuristic that has been implemented for question 3
    3. A comparison of the performance of different methods
    4. Include in the report the program corresponding to each algorithm that has been implemented. Describe in the report how these programs should operate.
- [ ] The programs that have been implemented (integrated into Norvig's program).

# Web Resources:

- 1000 starting configurations on the Sudoku Garden site (from where the 100 test configurations are taken). Each configuration occupies a line, composed of 81 digits, corresponding to the 81 squares, with the 9 lines concatenated. 0 means the square is empty (to be filled by your program).
