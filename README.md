# The Sudoku Game

This game from Japan is represented in a 9*9 grid, divided into 9 squares of 9 boxes. Some boxes already contain a number from 1 to 9. The goal is to fill the empty boxes so that each square, each row, and each column contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition. In other words, we should not find 2 identical numbers in the same square, the same row, or the same column.
